# Arduino-Piano
The Arduino piano is a piano made with Arduino components. Its idea is to challenge your music theory knowledge and to have fun while playing your favorite songs!


## Features:
- Playing notes
- Playing chords


As you may know, music is a very complex thing, but it's a fact that behind every song or melody sits music theory.
So let's see some of this theory. One of the features that our piano provides is the usage of chords, but what are chords? 
A chord is a group of notes played simultaneously and they can be major, minor, diminished, augmented or extended. One of the most common types of chords is triads, which consist of three notes. If we want to get the C major chord we need to press the notes C E and G on our Arduino piano, this chord gives a feeling of happiness. If we want to get the C minor chord we need to press the notes C Eb and G on our Arduino piano, this chord gives a feeling of sadness.
Here are images with other major and minor chords:
